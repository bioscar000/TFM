## Contents of the Repository

### 1. Experimental Data

All the experimental data used in this project can be found in the `raw_data` folder. These data are essential to perform the analyses and reproduce the results.

### 2. Python Utilities Script

The `utils.py` script contains specific functions developed during the Master Thesis. These functions are used in the Google Colab notebook to perform analysis and visualisations.

### 3. Google Colab Notebook (EXAMPLE.ipynb)

The Google Colab notebook `EXAMPLE.ipynb` is an interactive environment that shows you how to use the `utils.py` script functions to perform detailed analysis. You can open and run this notebook directly in Google Colab.

## Instructions for Running the Google Colab Notebook
